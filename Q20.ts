// 20.Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// List of Countries
const countries: string []= ["Pakistan","Dubai","Qatar","Kuwait","Japan","London"]
console.log("List of Countries:")
for(let List of countries) 
{
console.log(List)
}

// List of Languages
const languages: string []= ["Urdu","English","Arabic","French","Chines","Punjabi"]
for (let List of languages)
{
    console.log(List)
